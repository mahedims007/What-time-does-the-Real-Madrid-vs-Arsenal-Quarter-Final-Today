A Tactical Perspective
Real Madrid could have the muscle on Arsenal’s flanks early, holding a 4-2-4 lead. Valverde and Modric will look to dominate the middle of the field, Mbappé and Vinícius will look for the rare counterattack. The fighting will be literal and high press.
After absorbing pressure, they are compact defensively and Arsenal often breaks through Saka and Martinelli. Rice and parley were huddled behind with set pieces remaining a key weapon.
Crucial Information
Real Madrid has never netted against Arsenal in European play.

Predictions and Probabilities
Real Madrid are 6/1 on the left, Arsenal 1/7 to qualify.
Match Odds: Arsenal 7/2, Real Madrid 7/10, Draw 3/1.
We know the late-game magic that Real Madrid is capable of at the Bernabéu, so this one is far from over, not until that final whistle blows. So which side should be going through on paper? Arsenal.
At least Arsenal can head home with a respectable three-nil aggregate, with the rematch taking place at the Bernabéu. Many of its stars have missed out and Real Madrid will have to stage the most incredible comeback to stand a chance of reaching the last four. And now Arsenal, unsullied and unbowed in Europe, is gunning for a Champions League final, a far more exclusive destination
